## Content by User Type

### Experience Agencies

**Primary transformation:** Power impossible locations without generator drama
**Key differentiator:** Silent, venue-approved power for brand activations

**Top 3 Benefits:**
1. Get approved for impossible locations (hotels, rooftops, historic buildings)
2. Protect brand experience (no generator noise competing with activation)
3. Deploy faster, wrap faster (under 5 minutes, no fuel logistics)

**Pain Points:**
- Venues reject generators (noise, exhaust, insurance, fire code)
- Generator costs eat activation budgets ($500+/day + fuel + permits)
- Generator noise ruins ambient moments and video content
- Setup complexity reduces time for experience design

**Key Specs:**
- 10kW continuous (handles full AV/lighting rigs)
- Indoor/outdoor rated
- 7.5kWh capacity (8+ hours for typical activation)
- Fast charging between multi-day events (1 hour with 60A)

**Case Study:**
Luxury auto brand launch in hotel ballroom. Venue prohibited generators. Citypack powered LED wall, theatrical lighting, DJ booth for 6-hour event. Zero complaints, zero delays. Cost lower than generator plus special permits.

### Street Festivals

**Primary transformation:** Power festival without generator headache
**Key differentiator:** Silent, scalable battery power for entire festival footprint

**Top 3 Benefits:**
1. Scale power across festival footprint (one unit per zone, no massive generator infrastructure)
2. Zero noise impact on surrounding businesses (better community relations)
3. Simplified logistics and safety (no fuel deliveries during event, no crowd hazards)

**Pain Points:**
- Generators create noise complaints from businesses and residents
- Fuel delivery during events creates safety and access issues
- Generator exhaust conflicts with food vendor health codes
- Multi-block festivals require generator every block (cost multiplies)
- Annual permit renewals harder when neighbors complain
- Volunteers cannot safely manage generator refueling in crowds

**Key Specs:**
- 10kW continuous per unit (stage PA + lighting, or 8-12 vendor booths)
- 7.5kWh capacity (8-12 hours)
- Scalable deployment (1 to 10+ units)
- Fast charging between festival days
- All-weather operation

**Case Study:**
Three-block neighborhood street fair. Previous years: 2 large generators, 8 noise complaints/year, $1,200 in generator rentals plus fuel. Switched to 4 Citypack units. Zero noise complaints. Restaurants reported better patio sales. Festival committee: "First year in a decade without angry neighbors at city council meeting."

### Public Venues

**Primary transformation:** Say yes to more events without generator compromise
**Key differentiator:** Battery power protects venue, neighbors, and reputation

**Top 3 Benefits:**
1. Protect venue reputation (silent, exhaust-free matches space quality)
2. Open new revenue opportunities (ballrooms, courtyards, rooftops, gardens)
3. Eliminate neighbor complaints (better relationships, easier permits)

**Pain Points:**
- Generator noise damages venue ambiance and guest experience
- Neighboring properties complain about noise and exhaust
- Premium spaces cannot accommodate generators (indoor, rooftop, historic)
- Generator exhaust stains buildings and creates odor
- Fire marshal and insurance restrictions limit generator placement
- Generator failures create liability and reputation damage
- Saying "no" to events costs revenue

**Key Specs:**
- 10kW continuous (full event AV, lighting, catering)
- Indoor/outdoor rated
- Zero emissions (safe for occupied spaces, historic preservation)
- LFP chemistry (insurance-approved, fire-marshal friendly)
- 60A Bates + 3x 20A Edison
- Circuit breakers on all outlets (code compliant)

**Case Study:**
Historic museum hosts gala in sculpture garden. City ordinance prohibits generators in historic district after 8pm. Event runs 6pm-11pm. Citypack powered full AV, theatrical lighting, band for 400 people. Zero noise impact. Museum director: "First time in 15 years, zero noise complaints from neighbors. We can finally use outdoor space for evening events."

### Location Managers

**Primary transformation:** Get location approved, keep location happy
**Key differentiator:** Silent battery gets yes from property owners without compromising production power

**Top 3 Benefits:**
1. Easier location approvals (no generator noise/exhaust/fuel equals yes from owners)
2. Fewer neighbor complaints and shutdowns (silent operation, no curfews)
3. Protect location relationships (better return access, better references)

**Pain Points:**
- Property owners refuse due to generator noise and exhaust
- Neighbor complaints shut down shoots
- Generator damage to lawns/driveways creates disputes
- Noise curfews limit shooting hours (no generators 10pm-7am)
- Refueling spills damage property and create liability
- "One complaint and you're done" locations (schools, hospitals, residential)
- Last-minute rejections when owner hears "generator"
- Loss of future access after bad neighbor experiences

**Key Specs:**
- Silent operation
- 60A Bates + 3x 20A Edison (meets production needs)
- Compact cart (fits through gates and doorways)
- No refueling (eliminates spillage)
- Zero emissions (safe near occupied buildings)
- 7.5kWh capacity (full shooting day with load management)

**Case Study:**
Indie feature in residential neighborhood with difficult neighbors. Previous productions had permits revoked due to generator complaints. Location manager presented Citypack to HOA board. Silent operation convinced approval. Six-day shoot, zero complaints. HOA president: "You can film here again—first crew that didn't create problems."

### Production Managers

**Primary transformation:** Cut costs, cut delays, cut generator drama
**Key differentiator:** Battery power saves money, speeds wrap, eliminates logistics headaches

**Top 3 Benefits:**
1. Lower true costs than generators (fuel, permits, fire watch, refueling delays, wrap time)
2. Faster wrap equals more shooting time (no generator cooldown, power DIT while electric wraps)
3. Eliminate generator-related delays (no refueling interruptions, noise shutdowns, permit battles)

**Pain Points:**
- Generator rental cheap until fuel, permits, fire watch, delivery, crew time added
- Refueling delays cost shooting time (15-30 minute interruptions)
- Wrap delayed by generator cooldown (30-60 minutes paid crew time)
- Noise complaints shut down shoots, cost thousands
- Permit delays push shoot dates, cascade scheduling
- Fuel spills create cleanup costs and property damage
- Generator failures force expensive rentals or delays
- Budget line items multiply

**Key Specs:**
- Transparent rental cost (includes delivery, pickup, backup generator)
- Zero fuel costs (hundreds saved per day)
- Faster wrap (saves crew hours)
- 60A Bates + 3x 20A Edison (no workflow changes)
- 1-hour fast charging (rotate during lunch)
- White-glove service (production doesn't manage logistics)

**Case Study:**
Thirty-day commercial shoot across multiple locations. UPM compared costs:
- Generator total: $46,500 (rental + fuel + permits + fire watch + delivery)
- Citypack total: [Contact for pricing]
- Additional savings: 3 days noise delays avoided (estimated $18,000)
- Wrap improvement: Average 25 minutes faster/day (7.5 hours OT saved)

UPM: "Even if rental cost was the same, time savings made it worth it. But it actually cost less."

2. Charge in 1 hour, back to work (lunch break or setup time)
3. No refueling, no noise complaints, faster wrap (power DIT while electric wraps)

**Pain Points:**
- Generators slow wrap (cooldown wait, fuel cleanup)
- Neighborhood/venue noise complaints create delays
- Other batteries require adapters, cannot deliver real 60A
- Fuel costs and logistics eat crew time
- Location restrictions kill schedule (no generators 10pm-7am)
